New repo for the project.

New environment uses EJS instead of react which is a lot easier to use.

Setting up the server:

We're using MySQL. 
To get started, create a user named "pokedex" with a password "pikachu".
After doing that, create a database named "pokemon".
Then, import pokedex.sql into the database to populate it.

Launching the app:

Make sure you have Node installed on your computer.
To start, type "npm install" into your command line.
After that, use "node app.js" to start your app and head over to localhost:3000 to play around with it.
